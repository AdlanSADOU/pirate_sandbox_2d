# Getting started

## On Windows

First of all, you should have the Visual C++ compiler installed that comes with the Visual Studio Community.
Also, we're using Visual Studio Code for this project and it should `just work`.

To build this repository you'll need:
- `Visual Studio Community 2017` at least
- `Visual Studio Code`

- clone this repo somewhere
- open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`, type `code` to open vscode (so that you have access to windows development environment)
- open your clone in vscode as a Workspace
- build and run

---

If you are running this as a workspace in `Visual Studio Code` you can simply press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to build then `F5` to run.
If you want to run the Client make sure you are on the `Client` debug configuration in the debug panel (`Ctrl + Shift + D`).

If you dont, you're on your own.
